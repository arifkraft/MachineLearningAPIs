  # Introductory Statistics - Contents 

## 1. Basic Statistics

### 1.1 Principles of Descriptive and Inferential statistics
What are descriptive and inferential statistics and how are they different? Univariate: CDF Plot, Histograms, QQ Plot, Percentiles etc.
Bivariate: Scatter Plot, Surface Plot, Correlation etc. Multivariate Approaches: PCA and Clustering

### 1.2 Structure of Hypothesis Testing
Steps that need to be followed - From Defining the hypothesis to reject/failing to reject the null hypothesis

### 1.3 Types of Variables
Understanding difference between Experimental and Non-experimental research. Continuous and categorical variables, 
their subtypes and suitable statistical tests

### 1.4 Measures of Central Tendency and Spread 
Mean, Median and Mode. Most suitable CT for different distributions. Variance, variability and Standard Deviation

### 1.5 Statistical tests for hypothesis testing
[z-test, t-test, F-statistic, chi-square test, other tests] - Point Estimate, Confidence Interval, p-value of
significance and one/two tailed test 

## 2. Probability Theory

### 2.1 BasicÂ  Probability
Independent Events, Sample Space, Sampling with and without replacement, Joint Probability, Contitional Probability and Bayes' Rule

### 2.2 Random Variables and their distributions
Probability Mass Function (PMF) , Cumulative Distribution Function and Probability Density Function (for continuous RV). 
Relationship between PDF and CDF

### 2.3 Central Limit Theorem and Markov Chain(intuition)
Get the intuition behind these concepts

### 2.4 Covariance and Correlation 
Definition and Properties

### 2.5 Continuous Distributions
Uniform Distribution, Normal Distribution, Beta Distribution, Chi-Square Distribution

### 2.6 Discrete Distribution 
Binomial Distribution, Hyperemetric Distribution, Poisson Distribution, Negetive-Binomial Distribution
