## 1. Mode Analytics Problems
### 1.1 Write a query that returns songs that ranked between 10 and 20 (inclusive) in 1993, 2003, or 2013. Order the results by year and rank, and leave a comment on each line of theÂ WHEREÂ clause to indicate what that line does

```sql
SELECT year, year_rank, artist, 
       row_number() over(partition by year_rank order by year_rank) as row_num
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
  where year in (1993, 2003, 2013)
  and (year_rank>= 10 and year_rank<= 20)
  LIMIT 100;

```
